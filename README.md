# project3-DecisionTreeImplementation
DecisionTreeImplementation from scratch

For Iris dataset your task is to print steps for every split in the decision tree.

eg:-![123](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107025195/183817834-596c2c9a-3ab0-47df-9c8a-d46936db8c38.png)

Expected Output:
Level  0
Count of  0(False)  =  1
Count of  1(True)  =  3
Current Entropy  is =  0.811278124459
Splitting on feature  X1  with gain ratio  0.311278124459

Level  1
Count of  0  =  1
Count of  1  =  1
Current Entropy is =  1.0
Splitting on feature  X2  with gain ratio  1.0

Level  2
Count of  0  =  1
Current Entropy  is =  0.0
Reached leaf Node

Level  2
Count of  1  =  1
Current Entropy  is =  0.0
Reached leaf Node

Level  1
Count of  1  =  2
Current Entropy  is =  0.0
Reached leaf Node
